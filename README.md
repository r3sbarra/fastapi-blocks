`fastapi-blocks` is a Python package that allows you to structure your FastAPI applications using a modular "blocks" architecture. Each block is a self-contained component with its own routes, static files, and templates. This makes it easy to develop and maintain large FastAPI applications by breaking them down into smaller, reusable pieces.

## Installation

```bash
pip install fastapi-blocks
```

## Todo:

- [ ] Better mako
- [ ] Put more meaningful tests
- [ ] Add command to setup templates/default
